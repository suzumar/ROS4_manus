# Final phylogenetic Analysis

use manually created [file](LINK) UrdMUrdE.faa where the oxidase portion of UrdM homologues was selected

in [seaview](link) create an [alignment](LINK) using the muscle option

in seaview create a [block](LINK) using the gblocks with options below, followed by manual curation.

![gblocks](https://github.com/suzumar/rima_analysis/blob/main/files/figures/gblocks.png)

this block was imported into [MEGA11](link) and a modeltest run with the following [results](link)

In mega we ran both Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining Analysis using a macpro with the following [configuration]() and the following parameters:

![Neighbor Joining](https://github.com/suzumar/rima_analysis/blob/main/files/figures/gblocks.png)

For the final trees changed the pixel to 20 between branches and 300 for the tree using MEGA11
