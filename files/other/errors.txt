---------------------------------------------------
SUB10745205	PRJNA785135	SAMN23532070	Streptomyces sp. RO-S4 

And have come across the following issues which require your attention.


[1] In the inference qualifiers the ISfinder database is not 
recognized (see file posted on the portal).

[3] To resubmit the corrected files, do not create a new submission.  
Instead, log back into the wgs submission portal, 
https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/subs/wgs/, click 'FIX' 
for this submission.  If you have uploaded the files directly
in the submission portal, you will need to uncheck the files
flagged with errors and then upload replacement files. If you used
the preload option, you will need to resubmit all of the files.  The
previous files will be replaced with the new files from the preload directory.

Remember to click the submit button at the bottom of the overview page 
to complete the resubmission.

The submission statuses in the submission portal are:

   Unfinished: click on the SUB identifier in the submission column on the left side of the screen to complete your submission.
   Queued: the submission is waiting for automated validation
   Error: some or all files need to be fixed and resubmitted
   Processing: the submission has passed the automated validation and is waiting for manual review by NCBI staff.
   Processing and accession number present:  the submission has passed initial review and is waiting for final processing by NCBI staff. We will contact you during final processing if the submission has issues that require additional information.  If a release date was specified, the submission will not be reviewed until the release date expires.
   Processed: the wgs contigs have been publicly released. Note that any changes made to your submission will be included in the released data, but will not be displayed in the submission portal.


Sincerely,

Michel Eschenbrenner
Contractor
