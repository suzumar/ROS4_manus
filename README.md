# Introduction

This repository contains discussion, analysis pipelines, files and scripts used in the preprint https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.21.473593v1

**"Integrated metabolomic, molecular networking and genome mining analyses uncover novel angucyclines from Streptomyces sp. RO-S4 isolated from Bejaia Bay, Algeria"**

> Throughout this documentation the names in the final publication are diffeent than those used in the analysis.  Rather than exchange all names we provide the correspondence between names that are:

> RO-S4 is equivalent to S4  
> CTG2\_00170 is equivalent to S4\_00485 and LRR0\_00485  
> CTG2\_00177 is equivalent to S4\_00492 and LRR0\_00492  
> Since we do not keep the original paths in this distribution we add links to files necessary to reproduce our analysis whenever needed  
> We used different conda enviroments containing different packages so we will list the content of these environments. We also provide the system profile at some of the steps of the analysis
